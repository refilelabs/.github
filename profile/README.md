# re;file labs

Welcome to the **re;file labs** GitHub organization! We specialize in creating privacy-focused, browser-based file utilities that leverage the power of WebAssembly (WASM) to offer high-performance and secure tools for handling a wide range of file-related tasks.

## üåü Our Mission

At **re;file labs**, we believe in the power of tools that are:
- **Private**: Your files are never uploaded to a server. All processing happens directly in your browser, ensuring your data stays with you.
- **Efficient**: By using WASM, we deliver the performance of native applications directly in your web browser.
- **User-Friendly**: We strive to create intuitive, seamless experiences that make complex file operations accessible to everyone.

## üöÄ Key Projects

### 1. [**re;file labs website**](https://refilelabs.com)
A multi-functional utility platform where users can handle all kinds of file operations directly in their browser. Here's a glimpse of what our website offers:
- **Image Conversion**: Convert images to and from formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, and SVG.
- **Metadata Editing**: Modify metadata for images and documents while keeping everything local.
- **Image Editing**: Resize, crop, and tweak images effortlessly.
- **PDF Management**: Extract text from PDFs, edit PDF content, and more.

### 2. [**Image Tools**](https://refilelabs.com/image)
Our image tools are designed for all your visual needs. Easily compress, edit, and view image metadata, convert between various formats (including SVG), and perform advanced edits‚Äîall directly in your browser.

### 3. [**Document Utilities**](https://refilelabs.com/document)
Our document tools cover a wide range of functionalities, from extracting images and text to editing PDFs and modifying document metadata. Manage and manipulate documents with ease, securely and without server-side processing.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: High-performance code execution in the browser for fast and secure file operations.
- **Nuxt**: A powerful framework for building modern, responsive, and accessible frontend applications. Utilzing Nuxt's `layers`, we can create features in a modular way, usable by others.
- **Rust**: Utilized within our WASM utilities for safety, performance, and reliability.
- **Zig**: Leveraged for interoperability with existing C libraries, such as `libwebp`, to extend our image processing capabilities.

## üí° Why WASM?

WebAssembly allows us to bridge the gap between native desktop applications and the web. By combining **Rust** for safety and performance with **Zig** for seamless interoperability with existing C libraries, we can:
- Execute operations quickly without compromising user privacy.
- Build tools that are lightweight, powerful, and capable of handling complex file tasks.
- Offer a seamless cross-platform experience with a modern, responsive frontend powered by **Nuxt**.
